python script to export ibooks highlights from ibooks databases

highlights and notes are in the below file
Documents/storeFiles/AEAnnotation_v..._local.sqlite

in the ZAEANNOTATION TABLE

the Note is in the ZANNOTATIONOTE field
the Highlight is in the ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT field
the book id is in the ZANNOTATIONASSETID field

the book to ZANNOTATIONASSETID map is in the
Documents/BKLibrary_database/iBooks_v....sqlite file

in the ZBKBOOKINFO table

The book id is in the ZBOOKUNIQUEID field
The book title is in the ZBOOKTITLE field
if the book has DRM then the book id is in the ZDATABASEKEY field
ZDATABASEKEY and ZBOOKUNIQUEID are equal in all cases when the book is not DRMed. So ignore ZBOOKUNIQUEID and only use ZDATABASEKEY.


The script executes on these two dbs to export your notes and highlights.

The '...' are a random series of numbers. You need to get these files out of our iOS device by using a utility like phoneView.app
